1. Design and develop an algorithm to find the reverse of an integer number NUM and check whether it is PALINDROME or NOT. Implement a C program for the developed algorithm that takes an integer number as input and output the reverse of the same with suitable messages. Ex: Num: 2014, Reverse: 4102, Not a Palindrome

1. Design and develop a C program to read a year as an input and find whether it is leap year or not. Also consider end of the centuries.

1. Draw the flowchart and Write a C Program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor series approximation given by Sin(x) = x - (x3/3!) + (x5/5!) - (x7/7!) + …….

1. Design develop and Write c program compute cosine (x) .(hint: 1 - (1/2!)x2 + (1/4!)x4 - (1/6!)x6 ) using Taylor series.

1. Write a program in C to find the factorial of a number without using recursive C function.

1. Write a c –code to determine whether the given number is prime or not using function.

1. Develop a program to find the reverse of a string and check for palindrome or not Display appropriate messages.

1. An Electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity:

   - for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit.
   - for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit.
   - beyond 300 units Rs. 1 per unit.
   - All users are changed a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge.
   - If the total amount is more than Rs. 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged.

   Write a program to read the name of the user, number of units consumed and print out the charges.

1. Implement using functions to check whether the given number is prime and display appropriate messages (No built-in math function).

1. Develop a program to introduce 2D Array manipulation and implement Matrix multiplication and ensure the rules of multiplication are checked.

1. Write a C program to implement 2D array using pointer.

1. Develop a program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the builtin Library function. Print both the result with appropriate messages.

1. Develop a program to sort the given set of N numbers using any sorting algorithm.

1. Develop a program to find the square root of a given number N and execute for all possible Inputs with appropriate messages. Note: Don’t use library function sqrt(n).

1. Implement structures to read, write, and compute average marks and the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.

1. Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of n real numbers.

1. Write a C program to sort an array of structure (roll, name, total marks) in ascending order of total marks.
1. Implement Recursive functions for binary to Decimal Conversion.

1. Write a function to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length. Convince the parameters passing techniques.

1. Write a C program to insert five (5) records in a file and display it.
